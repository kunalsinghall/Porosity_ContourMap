# Porosity_ContourMap
It is a small code about making a Contour Map using the estimated porosity values of a field at equally spaced x,y positions in a reservoir. It is a 54 X 44 porosity matrix with each grid block being a square with sides 130.75 ft. This was a part of one of problems in the assignments of a Reservior Simulation course (PGE 323M - Reservoir Engineering III) that I'm taking online from University of Texas at Austin. It was taught by Professor John T. Foster in 2018.
